## Description
Implement a simple decision tree to classify data based on straightforward rules. This project introduces basic decision tree concepts.

## Objective: Build a decision tree classifier using simple rules.
Key Features: Decision tree classification.

##  Guidelines:
Function: Create a decision tree function classify() using if-else conditions based on feature thresholds.

## Example: 
Classify an individual as "high" or "low" income based on age and income thresholds.

## Dataset: Iris Dataset
Description: The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification tasks. It contains features of iris flowers and is often used to demonstrate decision tree algorithms.
