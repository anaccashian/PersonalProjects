## Description
Implement a machine learning model for text classification to categorize texts into multiple categories. This project introduces advanced classification techniques.

## Objective: Build a multi-class text classifier using a machine learning model.
Key Features: Multi-class text classification.

##  Guidelines:
Function: Use TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression from Scikit-Learn. Define train_model() and predict_class().

## Example: 
Classify texts into categories like "Technology", "Health", or "Finance".

## Python Code
x = "Hello"
